The folder: Analysis-and-figures-for-paper is designed to reproduce the results from the paper "Non-standard power grid frequency statistics in Asia, Australia, and Europe".

The data folder contains the data we used in the code.ipynb

The code.ipynb provides the tools to analyze time-series datasets, extracting various dataset properties including frequency distribution, dip statistics, stationary tests, and linear correlation analysis.
